//Adding this readme to describe what this specific project is about
//
//I am working on developing a website for a local chapter of a fraternal
//organization (KoC) that is comprised of mostly senior citizens. They are some
//of the nicest and most thoughtful old folks I ever done met and I have felt
//a calling in my heart/soul to develop a webpage for them. As of right now
//they currently use an analog "phone-roll" to call each other regarding
//their next meetings. Today, this changes. I am starting from scratch to 
//make a splash page, as well as other pages full of dynamic content. A
//part of this content will be a communication pathway and signup portal
//for their oprganization. I'm thinking mailing lists, newsletters, etc.
//As of 9/20/2022 this will remain private, however when I do open this
//up I will make note below. Time to grind it out! Keep the faith ya'll!!!!1!!
